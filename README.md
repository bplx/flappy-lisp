# flappy-lisp
My first game in Common Lisp!

## Synopsis
This is just a simple flappy-bird like game.

It was impressive to me, at least, because i'm very new to Common Lisp.

## Running
Only works on Linux due to not having a windows machine. I just didn't bother to test,
considering next to nobody would play this. The code should work cross-platform, the only thing
that is broken is that i don't have a precompiled Raylib binary for Windows. Plus, the shell scripts
use the Bourne Shell.
```
./build.sh # (optional, if you modified src/main.lisp)
./start.sh
```
