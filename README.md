# flappy-lisp
My first game in Common Lisp!

## Synopsis
This is just a simple flappy-bird like game.

It was impressive to me, at least, because i'm very new to Common Lisp.

## Running
(only works on linux, sorry!!)
```
./build.sh # (optional, if you modified src/main.lisp)
./start.sh
```

## Credits
Built with cl-raylib by longlene. Thanks!
