I should have just used Shinmera/deploy for the build system (facepalm..)
# flappy-lisp
My first game in Common Lisp!

## Synopsis
This is just a simple flappy-bird like game, built with cl-raylib.

## Running
(only works on linux, sorry!!)\
You need to have Quicklisp if you want to build :D
The game includes a prebuilt binary with ./start.sh so i reccomend that for most users.
```
./build.sh # (optional, if you modified src/main.lisp)
./start.sh
```

## Credits
Built with cl-raylib by longlene. Thanks!
